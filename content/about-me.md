- I don't post much about my personal life, but I'm a dual-citizen (french and canadian) living in Quebec-City. Outside work, I love outdoors, spending time in family, flying aircrafts (private pilot) and a bunch of other things.
- My professional path is frequently updated on my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilienmacchi).
- I sometimes post on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EmilienMacchi).
- If you want to reach out, please send me an [email](mailto:emacchi@pm.me).
